# dwc-gcode-core

G-code parsing for DuetWebControl plugins that follows what RepRapFirmware actually does, not what a
G-code line looks like it does.

- **An allocation-light line tokeniser** that never splits a comment out of a quoted string
  (`M291 P"done; resuming"`), handles RRF's `""` escapes and `{…}` expressions, and skips `N` line
  numbers.
- **Parameter parsing and in-place rewriting** on index spans, so rewriting one value leaves the
  rest of the line byte-identical.
- **A small table of what specific commands mean**, each entry checked against RRF source at a
  named release: `G10`'s three forms (tool settings, workplace offset, retraction), `M568`/`G10`
  tool temperatures including per-heater colon lists, and which commands' `P` is a tool number.

Pure TypeScript, zero runtime dependencies, no Vue, Pinia or DWC imports. It is bundled into each
plugin that uses it.

## Install

```bash
npm install dwc-gcode-core
```

## Use

```ts
import { g10Form, parseParams, paramNumber, readToolTemperatureSetting, setParam, tokenise, withBody } from "dwc-gcode-core";

const token = tokenise("G10 P1 S205:200 R150 ; tool 1");
token.code;                                      // "G10"
g10Form(token.body);                             // "toolSettings" — not a retraction
readToolTemperatureSetting(token.code, token.body);
// { tool: 1, active: [205, 200], standby: [150], setsTemperatures: true, heaterState: null }

paramNumber(parseParams("M116 P"), "P");         // null — a bare P waits for every tool; it is not tool 0
withBody(token, setParam(token.body, "P", "2")); // "G10 P2 S205:200 R150 ; tool 1"
```

Each module is also its own entry point (`dwc-gcode-core/lex`, `/params`, `/commands/g10`,
`/commands/toolParams`, `/rrf`), and the package is marked side-effect free, so a bundler keeps only
what a plugin imports.

## Tracking RepRapFirmware

`RRF_BASELINE` (and `package.json`'s `rrf.baseline`) names the RRF release every citation in this
package was checked against — currently **3.7.0-rc.1**.

When RRF releases, list the commits that could change what this package must recognise:

```bash
npm run triage -- 3.7.0-rc.1 3.7.0 --out docs/rrf-triage/3.7.0-rc.1..3.7.0.md
```

That lists every commit in the range touching RRF's G-code parser (`src/GCodes/GCodeBuffer/`) or
command dispatch (`src/GCodes/GCodes*.cpp`), as a checklist. It needs an authenticated `gh`. Each
item is closed as *no effect on syntax*, *recognition added* (code + test) or *semantic table
updated* (entry + citation + test). Only a fully closed list moves the baseline, and that commit is
tagged `rrf-<tag>` alongside the usual `vX.Y.Z` release tags.

`docs/wiki-discrepancies.md` records where the Duet3D G-code dictionary and RRF source disagree, with
evidence from both, so they can be reported upstream.
